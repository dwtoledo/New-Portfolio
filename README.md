# Portfolio Benchmarks
I have made some notes after analyzing 17 portfolio webpages, which I am now sharing with you:

## Favicon:

Almost all portfolios does't have favicon, some of then have:
- The developer initials;
- The developer avatar;
- Some unrecognized icons, or;
- Some funny icons (like a cat or chameleon).

> **Warning**
> The ***developer's avatar as favicon is not a good idea!***
>
> I will explain with details on Profile Section.

> **Note**
> For me, ***the simplest and most objective favicon is the developer's name initials!***.

## Header:
Recruiters claimed about the lack of ease of contact with their candidates. For this reason, ***a floating header with the essential contacts sounds to be a good idea!***, because it'll guarantee that the contacts will be available all the time on screen.

> **Warning**
> ***Don't use transparency.***
> 
> The portfolio content can confuse/mix with the header info.

A ***clean, minimal, and organized header*** is essential since this component will be floating on the user's screen, example:
- My ***name***;
- ***LinkedIn icon*** without the social name;
- ***GitHub icon*** without the social name;
- A highlighted ***"Send me a mail" button***;
- (Optional) Switch ***Light/Dark mode icon***.

## Profile:

***Should be simple and concise to allow space for your projects/skills, which is the main purpose when a recruiter accesses your portfolio.*** Some portfolios have the complete "About Me" (with picture, complete work experience, and others) on a separate page, and this could be a great idea, because the recruiter will enter this page after they have liked and are interested in your skills.

A simple and concise profile info on my page could be:
- Developer's ***name***;
- Professional ***headline***;
- ***Main technologies*** expertise.
  
> **Warning**
> ***Don't use technology icons only.***
>
> Some recruiters won't recognize technology just by icons, they must read instead;

> **Note**
> GitHub has an API that can be used to receive data from a public profile.
>
> In my case, (1) I use my name and bio data from the URL from:
> ```
> https://api.github.com/users/dwtoledo
> ```
> (2) I added technology and soft skills information as tags below my Software, Industry, and Entrepreneurship's overviews (3).
